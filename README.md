Hey all,

Last week during our Thursday end-of-day standup I talked very briefly Github collaboration workflow and optional participation in a practice repo.

Again, this is optional and extra material outside the curriculum so please feel free to ignore this email if you have other plans or interests you'd like to pursue this Thanksgiving break.

Here is the repo: https://github.com/ctb116/Team-Week-Practice-Repo

I sent out an invite to be a collaborator to the email you have on file with Epicodus. Please email me if you used a different email for Github or otherwise didn't get an invite.

Once you are able to access the repo as a collaborator, start by messing around in the repo and try out things from the Team Week lessons. It's okay if things break. My goal is for you to be exposed to all the things that can go wrong now so it is not so bad when it happens during Team Week. Merge conflicts are also a good thing to be exposed to early because they are not a bad thing but can feel overwhelming.

I'll be posting to the ReadMe soon a workflow a little different from the lessons to try out. I'll also post in the #oct-general channel any major updates about the repo to avoiding emailing anyone further who is not interested in participating.

I am not available this week for questions involving this repo. If questions come up please bring them to Monday stand up and we'll talk about them as a class. I'll also have a walkthrough prepared at that time.

Lastly other people will be messing around in this repo as well but you can create merge conflicts and trouble yourself by editing files and creating new branches directly in GitHub.

Have fun and break the repo!
